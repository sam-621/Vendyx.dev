## Setup
> [!NOTE]
> **Before running anything, you should have a postgresql database instance available.**

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn`
3. Add env variables in server package
4. `yarn build`
5. `yarn start`

### Local development
1. Add your database url in `default.config.ts` in core package
```ts
//...
db: {
  url: 'YOUR_POSTGRESQL_URL_CONNECTION'
},
//...
```

2. To populate your database (if needed), you should add your database url in `populate-db.ts` in the core package
```ts
const dataSource = await new DataSource({
  type: 'postgres',
  url: 'YOUR_POSTGRESQL_URL_CONNECTION',
  synchronize: false
}).initialize();
```

2. Run the following command
```bash
yarn db:populate
```

3. Run the api locally in the port 3000
```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Config urls in `constants.ts` file in admin-ui package adding the url for each environment
```ts
// This urls are just examples, you should add yours
const URLS: THashMap = {
  localhost: 'http://localhost:3000',
  development: 'https://ebloc-api-dev.com',
  production: ''
};
```

- If you are working with api and admin-ui packages, you should fill localhost url to test your api changes with frontend
- If you are working only with admin-ui, you should fill development url to not to have to run the api and instead of that use your api dev server

5. Run the admin-ui in the mode you need

Run in local mode (pointing to localhost url)
```bash
yarn local
```

Run in development mode (pointing to development url)
```bash
yarn dev
```
